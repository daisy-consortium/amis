AmisCore
--------
	Pick a platform by defining one of the following:
		AMIS_PLATFORM_OSX
		AMIS_PLATFORM_LINUX
		AMIS_PLATFORM_WINDOWS
	
	Pick a compiler
		AMIS_COMPILER_GCC
		AMIS_COMPILER_MSVC

	Say whether an external SMIL player is being used (like Ambulant):
		WITH_EXTERNAL_SMIL_PLAYER

AmisGuiMFC2
-----------
	Do we support protected books?  (PDTB 1.0 spec for Daisy 2.02 books)
		WITH_DAISY_PDTB
		HTML_LOAD_AMBULANT_PDTB
		WITH_PROTECTED_BOOK_SUPPORT
		
	Is Ambulant being given an HTML widget?
		WITH_HTML_WIDGET

	Is Ambulant not getting a log window?
		WITHOUT_LOG_WINDOW
		
	Use Ambulant workaround (I don't know what this is, but it seems helpful to have it defined)
		AMBULANT_SEEK_WORKAROUND
		
	This is in the self-voicing AudioSequencePlayer, and I don't know what it does.
		CCS_ACTIVE

	Use the speed-up algorithm for the Audio playback.  Question: does this just affect the self-voicing player or does it affect Ambulant too?
		WITH_TPB_AUDIO_SPEEDUP
