Installer creation README

Installer scripts are created from templates in main/. Install Python 2.x and Cheetah (http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/), and compile the templates:

  $./compile-templates.

This produces *.py files containing the compiled templates.

The localization data is contained in folders with the language ID. To create *.nsi files for each language:

 $./python build-installer.py 

(no parameters required; all available installers will be created).

Then, from Windows, run the resulting NSIS script as described here:
