Set up your directories like this:

top-level
	amis
		branches
			amis-core-library-refactor
				AmisCore
			bin
			lib
	xerces-c-src
		Build
		doc
		obj
		Projects
		samples
		scripts
		src
		tests
		tools
		createdocs.bat
		...lots more files...
	...

Get the code

To get xerces-c-src, download the latest xerces code from xml.apache.org, and unzip to that folder.  Make sure the nesting looks like it does here.

To get AmisCore, well, you already know where it is if you're reading this.  The AMIS code repository is controlled by Subversion, so use a good SVN client like TortoiseSVN or even just the command line tool.  If you are only checking out the AMIS Core folder, make sure to nest it properly as shown above.

Build the code

Build xerces by following their instructions.  The windows project file is located at /xerces-c-src/Projects/Win32/VC7.1/xerces-all/.   Build XercesLib in both release and debug modes.  Then copy the resulting lib and DLL files to the appropriate AMIS directory:

xerces-c_2_7.dll and xerces-c_2_7D.dll go in /amis/branches/amis-core-library-refactor/bin
xerces-c_2.lib and xerces-c_2D.lib go in /amis/branches/amis-core-library-refactor/lib

Open /amis/branches/amis-core-library-refactor/AmisCore/AmisCore.sln and try building it.  AmisCore will give you a static lib file, and testAmisCore will produce an executable.  You should change the paths in testAmisCore to something appropriate for your machine.
