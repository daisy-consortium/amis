<p>This document gives a brief introduction to AMIS, including its features, requirements, and options.  For a list of all commands and shortcut keys, please read the Keyboard Shortcuts document, found under the Help menu.</p>

<h2>What is AMIS?</h2>

<p>AMIS stands for <em>A</em>daptive <em>M</em>ultimedia <em>I</em>nformation <em>S</em>ystem.</p>

<p>AMIS is a software program that you can use to read DAISY talking books. It is self-voicing, meaning that no specialized screen-reading software is needed in order for it to be used by visually impaired people. AMIS is open source software and is provided free of charge.  It has been translated into dozens of languages.  Go to <a href="http://amisproject.org">http://amisproject.org</a> to download language packs.</p>

<h2>What is DAISY?</h2>

<p>DAISY stands for <em>D</em>igital <em>A</em>ccessible <em>I</em>nformation <em>SY</em>stem.  DAISY books are fully accessible talking books. Common features of books, such as sections, pages, footnotes, sidebars, and bookmarks are represented in a way that allows users to quickly navigate using them.</p>

<p>The DAISY standard is a globally recognized technical standard, originally developed to benefit people who are unable to read print due to a disability.  It also has broad applications for improved access to text in the mainstream.</p>

<p>The DAISY consortium was founded in 1996 and consists of a growing membership of organizations around the world committed to developing equitable access to information for people who have a print disability.</p>

<p>You can learn more about DAISY at <a href="http://daisy.org">http://daisy.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Supported Formats</h2>

<p>The following document formats are supported by AMIS:</p>

<ul>
<li>DAISY 2.02 </li>
<li>DAISY 3 (also referred to as ANSI/NISO z39.86-2005)</li>
<li>SMIL<sup>[1]</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>1. Any SMIL presentation must include a DAISY-formatted navigation file that references that presentation.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>The following PC configuration is required:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 2000</li>
<li>DirectX 9</li>
<li>SAPI 5.1 text-to-speech engine</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 7 <sup>[2]</sup></li>
<li>50 MB disk space</li>
</ul>

<p>The AMIS installer will report if a required component is missing.</p>

<p>2. Other versions of Internet Explorer will work, but this is the recommended version.</p>

<h2>Screen Layout</h2>

<p>The screen has two view modes: default and basic.  AMIS will start in default view mode unless you tell it to start in basic view (this setting is in the Preferences dialog).</p>

<p>The default view has four major pieces: a menu, a toolbar, a navigation window to the left, and a content window in the center of the screen.  The toolbar has eleven medium-sized buttons.  The sidebar contains one or more tabbed lists, depending on what the book contains.  The first list is always a hierarchical list of sections.  The second list contains page numbers (if the book has pages).  The subsequent lists contain special items such as footnotes or figures (again, if the book contains these items), with each item type appearing in its own list.</p>

<p>The basic view has two major pieces: a toolbar along the bottom of the screen and a content window in the center of the screen.  The toolbar has four large buttons.  There is no menu or sidebar in basic view mode.</p>
